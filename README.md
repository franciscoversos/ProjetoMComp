This project had the purpose of computing a FEM analysis of a fluid flowing in a perforated plate, designed in Solidworks and evaluated with Siemens NX. For two types of meshes, Q4 and Q4.
By exporting the coordinates of the nodes from Siemens NX(txt files), the analysis was done extensively in MATLAB and compared with the results obtained in NX. 
Download all the files into the same directory and run SimulationQ4 or Simulation Q8 to see the results
